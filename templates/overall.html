<p> <b> Scoring: </b> Click on a name to see a scoring breakdown. In the group stage, for each team that you guessed in the correct order, I awarded 1 point. For each team correctly
  chosen to advance to the round of 16, I awarded 2 points. For each team correctly predicted to advance to the Ro8, 5 points, for each correct team in the semis, 7 points, each finalist 12 points, and for the champion 19 points. The scoring system is known as the "fibbonacci" method of scoring brackets - the amount of points awarded for a correct prediction in a round is equal to the sum of the 2 previous rounds.
  The motivation for this system comes from this source <a href='http://www.jellyjuke.com/march-madness-bracket-scoring.html'> here</a>: it was found after trawling through loads of march madness prediction data, the fibonnaci method ensures that each round has roughly equal weight towards the final score. Actually read the link if you have time, the methodology for determining this "optimal" scoring method is simple and convincing.</p>
<p> <b> And the most entertaining bracket goes to... </b> Jamie Campbell, who made predictions based on which team had the coolest kits. See her (strong) opinions <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HZ7xXKupFxskzMOdizcqHgFjb2KOVhSoRkNDYbwIvdQ/edit#gid=979084073'>here</a>, as well as everyone else's original input. Y'all are a bunch of real comedians, DYK Germany beat Brazil 7-1 once???</p>
<p> <b> Misc: </b> Included in the leaderboard are some obviously non-human players - Alexi Lalas, EA sports, Goldman Sachs, etc. These companies made their picks so I just filled out brackets to see how they did. We also filled out brackets using ELO ratings and GDP.</p>
